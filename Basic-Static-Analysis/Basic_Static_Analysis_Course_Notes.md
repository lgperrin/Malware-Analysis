# Basic Static Analysis - Course Notes

## Basic Static Analysis - I

### Overview
- **Course:** CSC3059, Week 2, Lecture 02
- **Topic:** Malware Analysis

### Learning Outcomes
- Understanding static and dynamic analysis.
- Knowledge of how hashing and string matching work.

### Key Concepts
- **Malware Detection and Analysis**
  - Static Analysis: Examining a file without running it.
  - Dynamic Analysis: Examining a file by running it.
- **Static Analysis Applications**
  - First step in analyzing potential malware.
  - Gives basic to complete understanding of a suspicious file.
- **Advantages of Static Analysis**
  - Safer and allows understanding of program's actions without execution.
- **Antivirus Limitations**
  - Different results from various antiviruses.
  - Relies on signatures/heuristics.
- **String Matching and Hashing**
  - Techniques in static analysis for understanding executable actions and detecting known viruses.

### Summary
- Malware analysis involves understanding and applying concepts like strings and hashing.

## Basic Static Analysis - II

### Overview
- **Course:** CSC3059, Week 2, Lecture 03
- **Topic:** Malware Analysis

### Learning Outcomes
- Understand packing and obfuscated code.
- Analyze software for external library loads.

### Key Concepts
- **Packed/Obfuscated Files**
  - Hides functionality, making static analysis difficult.
- **Portable Executable (PE) Format**
  - For Windows executables and DLLs.
  - Analyzed using tools like PEView.
- **Dynamic Linking**
  - Common in malware, analyzed using Dependency Walker.
- **Resource Hacker Tool**
  - Browses the .rsrc section of PE files, often used by malware.

### Static Analysis Checklist
- Run in VirusTotal.com.
- Check if packed using PEiD.
- Analyze PE header with PEView.
- Analyze imports/exports with Dependency Walker.

### Summary
- Focus on tools and methods for unpacking/analyzing packed and obfuscated code.
