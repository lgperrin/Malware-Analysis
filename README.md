# Malware Analysis

This repository stores the practical and theoretical skills needed to analyse real-world malware. During this module, you will have the opportunity to disassemble real malware files to reveal the secrets hidden within their x86 assembly code. You will learn how to run and analyse malware in a virtual environment using the same tools as professional malware analysts.
